            <h2 class="warning">Where do incidents happen?</h2>
            <p>Crashes predominanetly happen in wealthier countries with the United States being an extreme outlier. There are over <span class="warning">10,000</span>  more plane owning individuals in America then the second highest country and plenty of airspace to experiment in!</p>
            <br>
            <p>Despite China and India's large populations, the two have a relatively safe records compared to other populous neighbors such as Indonesia and Japan.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Even with a relatively high number of small aircraft, most African countries only have <span class="warning">"those few incidents"</span>. Meanwhile, flying planes is becoming a increasingly popular hobby in South American Countries...</p>

            <h2 class="warning">Who makes incidents happen?</h2>
            <p>Boeing. Boeing makes crashes happen.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Currently there are more Airbus A320's in the air than Boeing <span class="warning">737</span>'s yet Boeing's signature craft is far and away the leader of Aircraft Incidents.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Boeing's other craft don't fall far from the tree with the <span class="warning">747</span>, <span class="warning">757</span>, and <span class="warning">767</span> all scoring more incidents than either of Airbus or McDonnell Douglas's biggest offerings.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Embraer mostly makes smaller aircraft, combined with their manufacturing prowess, the result is an impressively small number of incidents.</p>
            <br>
            <p>With the recent Boeing <span class="warning">737 Max</span> crisis, here's hoping Boeing lives up to their slogan, <span class="warning"><i>Forever New Frontiers</i></span>.</p>

            <h2 class="warning">Will an incident kill you? The plane? Should you even book a flight?</h2>
            <p>The short answer is, well, no. The vast majority of incidents <span class="warning">did not</span> result in death.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Even so, the the majority of planes were reportedly put out of commission by incidents, with over half of known incidents causing <span class="warning">substantial damage</span> all the way to <span class="warning">destruction.</span></p>
            <br>
            <p>The only question that remains...    ...shoudld you book that flight? The vast majority of airplane incidents are on scheduled flights but given that over <span class="warning">90%</span> of current airborn flights are scheduled commercial flights, the statistics are actually in favor of being safer if scheduled. So go ahead, what are you waiting for, <span class="warning">book that vacation</span>!</p>
